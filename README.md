# Los Pollos Hermanos

Welcome to the **Los Pollos Hermanos** project! üêîüçó

This project is inspired by the fictional fast food restaurant chain, **Los Pollos Hermanos**, featured in the hit TV series _Breaking Bad_ and its spin-off _Better Call Saul_. While the restaurant may be fictional, this project is all about real coding fun!

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to:

- **Improve C# and .NET skills**: I'll be diving deeper into the .NET ecosystem, exploring libraries, frameworks, and best practices.
- **Explore .NET libraries and frameworks**: Whether it's ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework, or other cool libraries, this project serves as my playground for experimenting and learning.
- **Have fun with the Breaking Bad theme**: Since _Breaking Bad_ is one of my all-time favorite TV shows, I'm incorporating the iconic _Los Pollos Hermanos_ as the theme for this project to make it more enjoyable!

## Why Los Pollos Hermanos?

Why not! _Breaking Bad_ has always been a favorite of mine, so why not use its iconic fast-food chain as inspiration? This project might not serve fried chicken, but it'll serve up some solid code! üçóüíª

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: C#
- **Framework**: .NET 8
